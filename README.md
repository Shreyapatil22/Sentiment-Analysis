##Sentiment analysis is a key application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves classifying textual data into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. This project aimed to develop a sentiment analysis model using machine learning techniques. The process began with data preprocessing, where text was cleaned by removing special characters, stopwords, and converting it into a numerical format using TF-IDF vectorization. A Logistic Regression model was then trained on the processed data to classify sentiments accurately. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports, providing insights into its effectiveness. Despite challenges like handling neutral sentiments, imbalanced data, and TF-IDF’s lack of contextual understanding, the model performed well. Future improvements could include using deep learning models like BERT or LSTM, incorporating word embeddings, and expanding the dataset for better generalization. This project highlights the importance of NLP in extracting meaningful insights from textual data.
